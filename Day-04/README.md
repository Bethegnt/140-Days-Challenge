### **Time Complexity** 

**Algorithm Complexity** :

Suppose X is treated as an algorithm and N is treated as the size of input data, the time and space implemented by the Algorithm X are the two main factors which determine the efficiency of X.

**Time Factor** :
The time is calculated or measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in sorting algorithm.

**Space Factor** : 
The space is calculated or measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.

#### **Space Complexity** :
- Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space needed the algorithm in its life cycle.
- Space needed by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components
- A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables (i.e. simple variables and constants, program size etc.), that are not dependent of the size of the problem.
- A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size is totally dependent on the size of the problem. For example, recursion stack space, dynamic memory allocation etc.

#### **Time Complexity** :
Time Complexity of an algorithm is the representation of the amount of time required by the algorithm to execute to completion. Time requirements can be denoted or defined as a numerical function t(N), where t(N) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step takes constant time.
